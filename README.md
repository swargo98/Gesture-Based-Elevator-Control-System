# Gesture Based Elevator Control System
 
For our CSE316 term project, we have built a system where we can use an elevator to go to a certain floor of a building, only by our hand gestures. This will help us a lot in avoiding touching buttons in this COVID-ridded world. We used ATMEGA micro controllers and LDR-LED couples, which is very cost effective and can be easily implement the system even in the suburban cities.
